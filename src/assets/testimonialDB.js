    "testimonial":"We went over last week's assignments, including the chromatic scale, C Major Scale, C Major chords, and strumming. We added on variations on the chromatic scale, with an emphasis on playing the original faster and more precisely. I am still struggling with hammer-on's, but Paul was very supportive. We're finally getting through the strum pattern on the song I started with – Fake Plastic Trees – and I'm realizing how much easier it is to play all the way through after we've been working on individual components of my technique.",

He was also flexible in scheduling our first lesson. I particularly appreciated his inquisitive approach when I didn't understanding something.

While I've met many guitar players who were capable, I wanted the best guitar teacher I could find and not ONLY is Paul an excellent guitar player, but he's an excellent teacher as well. His patience while I worked through more advanced techniques was incredible and his ability to provide the learning material in simple terms helped immensely. If you're looking for a guitar player to teach you, you can find those anywhere. But if you want an amazing guitar player with equally impressive teaching abilities, Paul is your ideal teacher. I 100% recommend him without question.",
